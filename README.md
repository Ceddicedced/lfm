# :palm_tree: Last.fm RSS
Last time I scraped the site and parsed the html of last.fm, this time I decided to use the API. I thought that would serve me better, and in a way, it does. 

But I also wept. How is it possible that two almost identical endpoints have the key names differ on several spots or complete absent. 

Anyhow,on https://lfm.xiffy.nl/ you can get your Last.fm RSS Feeds!

You know the drill;

```(bash)
# git clone git@github.com:xiffy/lfm.git
# cd lfm
# virtualenv -p python3 venv
# . venv/bin/activate
# pip install -r requirements.txt
```
